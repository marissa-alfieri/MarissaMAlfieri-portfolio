I am a senior at Boston University pursuing clinical psychology PhD programs with a focus on developmental psychopathology. Multiple psychological processes interact uniquely across individuals, so studying various mechanistic interactions is essential for identifying emotion regulation pathways. Since equifinality and multifinality characterize developmental pathways, I aim to investigate not whether variation occurs, but why different individuals follow different trajectories.

I want to identify how interactions between psychological mechanisms (such as emotion regulation, stress reactivity, and executive function) shape individual developmental risk trajectories in emotion dysregulation and psychopathology. This requires examining within-person patterns to recognize various mechanistic interactions that contribute to psychopathology, which group-level methods may obscure.

## Research Background

My research experience spans multiple labs at Boston University, including work with Dr. Catherine Caldwell-Harris on language interpretation studies and collaboration with Dr. Laura M. Jiménez on race-based trauma research. I have also conducted cross-cultural research in Italy as part of my honors thesis.
